## What's this?

[Play demo](https://mawxiwtz.github.io/rogueclone2s-wasm/)

This project is a WebAssembly build of "Rogue Clone 2s (UTF-8)" compiled using Emscripten. Terminal emulation in the browser is provided by xterm.js, and the xterm-pty addon is used to bridge the WebAssembly output to xterm.js.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the developers of these excellent software projects.
